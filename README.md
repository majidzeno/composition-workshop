## About
**Composition workshop** is a set of exercises designed to help developers learn and practice using the Composition API, a new feature introduced in Vue 3 for building reusable and modular Vue components. The workshop includes exercises covering various topics such as setting up and using reactive references, defining methods, creating computed properties, and working with lifecycle hooks and watchers.

By completing these exercises, developers will gain a better understanding of how to use the Composition API to build powerful and maintainable Vue applications. The workshop provides a hands-on approach to learning, allowing developers to practice and experiment with the Composition API in a structured and guided way.
